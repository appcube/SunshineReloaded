# SunshineReloaded
This is a enhanced example of the [Sunshine project](https://github.com/udacity/Sunshine-Version-2)
implemented using popular android libraries and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org).

You have to define your own openweathermap api key. Create `gradle.properties` file in the root folder and add your key:
```
WeatherApiKey=12345...
```
